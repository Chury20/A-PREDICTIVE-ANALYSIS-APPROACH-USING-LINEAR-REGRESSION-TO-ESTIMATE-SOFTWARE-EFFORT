# A-PREDICTIVE-ANALYSIS-APPROACH-USING-LINEAR-REGRESSION-TO-ESTIMATE-SOFTWARE-EFFORT
ABSTRACT.          Software engineering projects typically have a higher level of uncertainty and its very difficult to accurately estimate the time required to do work when there is a high level of uncertainty associated with the work to be done.        Predicting software quality requires high accurate tools and high-level experience. AI-based predictive models, on the other hand, are useful tools with an accurate degree that help to make decisions learning from past data. In this study, to build a software effort estimation model to predict the effort before the project development lifecycle, using a linear regression model and also using non-parametric validation model through a Knn regression algorithm.
